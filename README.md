# KoroKatalog

# Functionality
KoroKatalog streamlines the lending process by tracking these datas.

- The Asset: What is being borrowed? (e.g., shirt, instrument, or accessories).

- The Borrower: Detailed contact information, including their name and phone number, ensuring the owner knows exactly how to reach them.

- The Timeline: Date Borrowed: Establishes a historical record of when the item left your possession.

Due Date: Sets a clear expectation for when the item should be returned, helping to prevent "permanent borrowing."
